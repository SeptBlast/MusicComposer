# MusicComposer
AI Based Music Composer

â€‹Overview
============
A project that trains a LSTM recurrent neural network over a dataset of MIDI files. More information can be found on the [writeup about this project](http://yoavz.com/music_rnn/). This the code for 'Build an AI Composer' on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/S_f2qV2_U00)

Dependencies
============

* Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* Tensorflow (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
* Python Midi (https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi.git)
* Mingus (https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Installation (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
============

* Step 1: Tensorflow version 0.8.0 must be used. On [Tensorflow's download page here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html), scroll down to "Pip Installation". Follow the first step normally.

You will see "export TF_BINARY_URL" followed by a URL. Modify the part of the url that has "tensorflow-0.10.0", so that it will download version 0.8.0, not version 0.10.0 "tensorflow-0.8.0. 

Example of the modified url, for the Python 2.7 CPU version of Tensorflow:

```
export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

sudo pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
```
Follow the third step normally to install Tensorflow.

* Step 2: After installing Tensorflow, you will have to install the missing dependencies:

`pip install matplotlib`

`sudo apt-get install python-tk `

`pip install numpy`

* Step 3:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi
cd python-midi
python setup.py install
```

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus
cd python-mingus
python setup.py install
```


Basic Usage
===========

1. `mkdir data && mkdir models`
2. run 'python main.py'. This will collect the data, create the chord mapping file in data/nottingham.pickle, and train the model
3. Run `python rnn_sample.py --config_file new_config_file.config` to generate a new MIDI song.

Give it 1-2 hours to train on your local machine, then generate the new song.
